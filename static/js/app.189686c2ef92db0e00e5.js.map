The neural network models are discriminatively trained using the clickthrough data such that the conditional likelihood of the clicked document given the query is maximized. Different from the previous latent semantic models that are learned in an unsupervised fashion, the models are optimized directly for Web document ranking, and thus give superior performance. Furthermore, to deal with large vocabularies, researchers propose the so-called word hashing method, through which the high-dimensional term vectors of queries or documents are projected to low-dimensional letter based n-gram vectors with little information loss.\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"2.

Each query-title pair has a relevance label. The label is human generated and is on a 5-level relevance scale, 0 to 4, where level 4 means that the document is the most relevant to query Q and 0 means D is not relevant to Q. All the queries and documents are preprocessed such that the text is white-space tokenized and lowercased, numbers are retained, and no stemming/inflection is performed.

It generates a interaction matrix which captures every exact match (and position) of query terms in the document. The interaction matrix is first passed through a convolutional layer and then passed through two fully-connected layers, a dropout layer, and a final fully-connected layer that produces a single real-valued output.The distributed model learns dense lower-dimensional vector representations of the query and the document text, and then computes the positional similarity between them in the learnt embedding space. Instead of a one-hot encoding of terms, as in the local model, it use a character n-graph based representation of each term in the query and document. The character-based input then pass through convolution step and then conduct a max-pooling step. The output of the max-pooling layer for the query is then passed through a fully-connected layer. For the document, the output is operated on by another convolutional layer. Finally, it conduct the element-wise or Hadamard product between the embedded document matrix and the extended or broadcasted query embedding.

The neural network models are discriminatively trained using the clickthrough data such that the conditional likelihood of the clicked document given the query is maximized. Different from the previous latent semantic models that are learned in an unsupervised fashion, the models are optimized directly for Web document ranking, and thus give superior performance.

Each query-title pair has a relevance label. The label is human generated and is on a 5-level relevance scale, 0 to 4, where level 4 means that the document is the most relevant to query Q and 0 means D is not relevant to Q.

Firstly, the word embedding layer maps each word to an L-dimension continuous vector. Secondly, the convolutional layer applies convolution filters to compose n-grams from the text. A convolution filter slide over the text like a sliding window. Thirdly, the cross-match layer matches query n-grams and document n-grams of different lengths.

For example, the ranking-related objective functions include several well-known pointwise, pairwise and listwise losses. It is flexible for users to pick up different objective functions in the training phase for optimization. Once a model has been trained, the toolkit could be used to produce a matching score, predict a matching label, or rank target texts (e.g., a document) against an input text.</p>\n\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n  export default {\n    name: 'IntroRightCard'\n  }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n  #introrightcard {\n    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol;\n  }\n\n  a {\n    color: #0366d6;\n    background-color: initial;\n    text-decoration: none;\n  }\n\n  a:hover {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n  }\n\n  h2 {\n    display: block;\n    font-size: 1.5em;\n    margin-block-start: 0.83em;\n    margin-block-end: 0.83em;\n    margin-inline-start: 0px;\n    margin-inline-end: 0px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\n  h3 {\n    display: block;\n    font-size: 1.17em;\n    margin-block-start: 1em;\n    margin-block-end: 1em;\n    margin-inline-start: 0px;\n    margin-inline-end: 0px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\n  #h2-1 {\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #eaecef;\n    padding-bottom: .3em;\n  }\n\n  #h3-1 {\n    font-size: 1.25em;\n    font-weight: 600;\n    line-height: 1.25;\n    margin-bottom: 16px;\n    margin-top: 24px;\n  }\n\n  #h3-2 {\n    font-size: 1.25em;\n    font-weight: 600;\n    line-height: 1.25;\n    margin-bottom: 16px;\n    margin-top: 24px;\n  }\n\n  #h3-3 {\n    font-size: 1.25em;\n    font-weight: 600;\n    line-height: 1.25;\n    margin-bottom: 16px;\n    margin-top: 24px;\n  }\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/MatchZoo/Index/IntroRightCard.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0,false,false)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"introrightcard\"}},[_c('h2',{attrs:{\"id\":\"h2-1\"}},[_c('a',{staticClass:\"anchor\",attrs:{\"id\":\"user-content-overview\",\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",\"href\":\"#overview\"}}),_vm._v(\"\\n    Overview\\n  \")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The architecture of the MatchZoo toolkit is described in the Figure  in what follows,\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('img',{staticStyle:{\"max-width\":\"100%\"},attrs:{\"src\":require(\"../../../assets/overview.png\"),\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"200\",\"alt\":\"图片名称\",\"align\":\"center\"}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"There are three major modules in the toolkit, namely data preparation, model construction, training and evaluation, respectively.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>The DRMM stands for the Deep Relevance Matching Model, which is a model published in CIKM 2016. The paper title is “A Deep Relevance Matching Model for Ad-hoc Retrieval”. Given a query and a set of documents, DRMM employs a joint deep architecture at the query term level for relevance matching. By using matching histogram mapping, a feed forward matching network, and a term gating network, it effectively capture the three relevance matching factors: exact matching signals, query term importance, and diverse matching requirements.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the DRMM is shown in the figure. DRMM employs a joint deep architecture at the query term level over the local interactions between query and document terms for relevance matching. It first builds local interactions between each pair of terms from a query and a document based on term embeddings. For each query term, it then transforms the variable-length local interactions into a fixed-length matching histogram. Based on the fixed-length matching histogram, it employs a feed forward matching network to learn hierarchical matching patterns and produce a matching score for each query term. Finally, the overall matching score is generated by aggregating the scores from each single query term with a term gating network computing the aggregation weights.</p>\n                <h2>3. Performances</h2>\n                <p>The experiments of DRMM is conducted on two TREC collections, Robust04 and ClueWeb09-Cat-B.

DRMM employs a joint deep architecture at the query term level over the local interactions between query and document terms for relevance matching. It first builds local interactions between each pair of terms from a query and a document based on term embeddings. For each query term, it then transforms the variable-length local interactions into a fixed-length matching histogram. Based on the fixed-length matching histogram, it employs a feed forward matching network to learn hierarchical matching patterns and produce a matching score for each query term. Finally, the overall matching score is generated by aggregating the scores from each single query term with a term gating network computing the aggregation weights.\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"3.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>DSSM stands for Deep Structured Semantic Model, or more general, Deep Semantic Similarity Model. It is developed for representing text strings (sentences, queries, predicates, entity mentions, etc.) in a continuous semantic space and modeling semantic similarity between two text strings (e.g., Sent2Vec) by the MSR Deep Learning Technology Center(DLTC).</p>\n                <p>DSSM uses a deep neural network (DNN) to rank a set of documents for a given query as follows. First, a non-linear projection is performed to map the query and the documents to a common semantic space. Then, the relevance of each document given the query is calculated as the cosine similarity between their vectors in that semantic space. The neural network models are discriminatively trained using the clickthrough data such that the conditional likelihood of the clicked document given the query is maximized. Different from the previous latent semantic models that are learned in an unsupervised fashion, the models are optimized directly for Web document ranking, and thus give superior performance. Furthermore, to deal with large vocabularies, researchers propose the so-called word hashing method, through which the high-dimensional term vectors of queries or documents are projected to low-dimensional letter based n-gram vectors with little information loss.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The figure on the right is an illustration of the DSSM. It uses a DNN to map a 500K sparse feature vector to a dense vector in 128 dimensions. The original input vector x contains 500k dimensions, which are reduced to 30k by word hashing method. Then, as we can see in the figure, 3 layers of non-linear projections are performed. A 30k * 300 weight matrix W2 and a bias b2 with 300 dimensions is used to transform the first layer with 30k units to the second layer with 300 units. And so on, the second layer with 300 units is transformed to the third layer with 300 units, and the third layer is then transformed to the final result vector y with 128 dimensions.</p>\n                <h2>3. Performances</h2>\n                <p>researchers have evaluated the retrieval models on a large-scale real world data set, called the evaluation data set henceforth. The evaluation data set contains 16,510 English queries sampled from one-year query log files of a commercial search engine. On average, each query is associated with 15 Web documents (URLs). Each query-title pair has a relevance label. The label is human generated and is on a 5-level relevance scale, 0 to 4, where level 4 means that the document is the most relevant to query Q and 0 means D is not relevant to Q. All the queries and documents are preprocessed such that the text is white-space tokenized and lowercased, numbers are retained, and no stemming/inflection is performed. The performance of all ranking models researchers have evaluated has been measured by mean Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) , and NDCG scores will be reported at truncation levels 1, 3, and 10.</p>\n                <p>The main results of experiments are summarized in the following table, where researchers compared the best version of the DSSM (Row 12) with three sets of baseline models. The first set of baselines includes a couple of widely used lexical matching methods such as TF-IDF (Row 1) and BM25 (Row 2). The second is a word translation model (WTM in Row 3) which is intended to directly address the query-document language discrepancy problem by learning a lexical mapping between query words and document words. The third includes a set of state-of-the-art latent semantic models which are learned either on documents only in an unsupervised manner (LSA, PLSA, DAE as in Rows 4 to 6) or on clickthrough data in a supervised way (BLTM-PR, DPM, as in Rows 7 and 8).</p>\n                <table class=\"result-data\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n                  <tr>\n                    <th class=\"top-line\">Models</th>\n                    <th class=\"top-line\">NDCG@1</th>\n                    <th class=\"top-line\">NDCG@3</th>\n                    <th class=\"top-line\">NDCG@10</th>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">TF-IDF</td>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">0.319</td>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">0.382</td>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">0.462</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>BM25</td>\n                    <td>0.308</td>\n                    <td>0.373</td>\n                    <td>0.455</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>WTM</td>\n                    <td>0.332</td>\n                    <td>0.400</td>\n                    <td>0.478</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>LSA</td>\n                    <td>0.298</td>\n                    <td>0.372</td>\n                    <td>0.455</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>PLSA</td>\n                    <td>0.295</td>\n                    <td>0.371</td>\n                    <td>0.456</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>DAE</td>\n                    <td>0.310</td>\n                    <td>0.377</td>\n                    <td>0.459</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>BLTM-PR</td>\n                    <td>0.337</td>\n                    <td>0.403</td>\n                    <td>0.480</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>DPM</td>\n                    <td>0.329</td>\n                    <td>0.401</td>\n                    <td>0.479</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">DNN</td>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">0.342</td>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">0.410</td>\n                    <td class=\"top-line\">0.486</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>L-WH linear</td>\n                    <td>0.357</td>\n                    <td>0.422</td>\n                    <td>0.495</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>L-WH non-linear</td>\n                    <td>0.357</td>\n                    <td>0.421</td>\n                    <td>0.494</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">L-WH DNN</td>\n                    <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">0.362</td>\n                    <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">0.425</td>\n                    <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">0.498</td>\n                  </tr>\n                </table>\n                <h2>4.

First, a non-linear projection is performed to map the query and the documents to a common semantic space. Then, the relevance of each document given the query is calculated as the cosine similarity between their vectors in that semantic space. The neural network models are discriminatively trained using the clickthrough data such that the conditional likelihood of the clicked document given the query is maximized. Different from the previous latent semantic models that are learned in an unsupervised fashion, the models are optimized directly for Web document ranking, and thus give superior performance. Furthermore, to deal with large vocabularies, researchers propose the so-called word hashing method, through which the high-dimensional term vectors of queries or documents are projected to low-dimensional letter based n-gram vectors with little information loss.\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"2.

The original input vector x contains 500k dimensions, which are reduced to 30k by word hashing method. Then, as we can see in the figure, 3 layers of non-linear projections are performed. A 30k * 300 weight matrix W2 and a bias b2 with 300 dimensions is used to transform the first layer with 30k units to the second layer with 300 units. And so on, the second layer with 300 units is transformed to the third layer with 300 units, and the third layer is then transformed to the final result vector y with 128 dimensions.\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"3.

The evaluation data set contains 16,510 English queries sampled from one-year query log files of a commercial search engine. On average, each query is associated with 15 Web documents (URLs). Each query-title pair has a relevance label. The label is human generated and is on a 5-level relevance scale, 0 to 4, where level 4 means that the document is the most relevant to query Q and 0 means D is not relevant to Q. All the queries and documents are preprocessed such that the text is white-space tokenized and lowercased, numbers are retained, and no stemming/inflection is performed.

The second is a word translation model (WTM in Row 3) which is intended to directly address the query-document language discrepancy problem by learning a lexical mapping between query words and document words.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>The CDSSM is an extension model based on DSSM. It uses the same token level encoding strategy, and build multi-layer convolution to get the semantic representation of sentences, instead of the DNN in DSSM. The output layer is the same as DSSM.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the CDSSM is shown in the figure. It employs a convolution layer at first to encode sentence with context information, which is different from the method in DSSM. In this paper, the kernel size (sliding window length) is set to be 3. The convolution layer encodes the window to a low dimension dense vector as DSSM does. After the final convolution layer, a dense transfer a 300-d vector to 128-d. The similarity between different documents can be compute by the cosine of their low dimension representation.</p>\n                <h2>3.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>ARC-I is a representation-based model designed for semantic matching task. The model utilizes padding and mask method to deal the length variability. ARC-I uses word embeddings to capture semantic information instead of traditional one-hot encoding method, then uses convolution and max-pooling layers to get the sentence representation individually. In the final, it compares the representation for the two sentences with a multi-layer perceptron.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the ARC-I is shown in the figure. ARC-I employs a Siamese architecture to model two sentences.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>ARC-II is an interaction-based model designed for semantic matching task, which has a desirable property of getting sentences interaction details before high-level representation mature. The first convolution layer computes the interaction by sliding window and get rich features. The following layers utilize 2D-conv to extract matching pattern. The output layer is a multi-layer perceptron and get matching degree directly.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the ARC-II is shown in the figure. With encoded by pre-trained word embeddings, the model utilizes sliding window convolution to get context matching similarity, the following 2D-conv extract matching features. The matching degree is generated by MLP directly.</p>\n                <h2>3.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>Inspired by the success of convolutional neural network in image, the MatchPyramid proposes a novel view of text matching task, and models this task as the problem of image recognition. This model constructs a matching matrix to represent the similarities between words, then use a convolutional neural network to capture rich matching patterns in layer-by-layer way.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the MatchPyramid is shown in the figure. Firstly, MatchPyramid employs a matching matrix to bridge the gap between text matching and image recognition, it uses three different methods to model the similarity between tokens of two involved texts, as indicator function, cosine and dot product. Then it uses hierarchical convolutional layers to capture rich grains matching patterns from token level to sentence level. For the first convolution layer, it uses dynamic pooling strategy to handle text length variance. The matching score is produced by a multi-layer perception, and the object function can be change to fit different requirement of tasks.</p>\n                <h2>3. Performances</h2>\n                <p>MatchPyramid conducts experiments on two tasks, i.e. paraphrase identification and paper citation matching. The result for paraphrase identification is summarized in table 1.</p>\n                <table class=\"result-data\" cellspacing=0>\n                    <caption>Table1: Results on MSRP.</caption>\n                    <tr>\n                      <th class=\"top-line\">Model</th>\n                      <th class=\"top-line\">Acc.(%)</th>\n                      <th class=\"top-line\">F<sub>1</sub>(%)</th>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">ALL POSITIVE</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">66.50</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">79.87</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>TF-IDF</td>\n                      <td>70.31</td>\n                      <td>77.62</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">DSSM</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">70.09</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">80.96</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>CDSSM</td>\n                      <td>69.80</td>\n                      <td>80.42</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>ARC-I</td>\n                      <td>69.60</td>\n                      <td>80.27</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>ARC-II</td>\n                      <td>69.90</td>\n                      <td>80.91</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">MP-IND</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">75.77</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">82.66</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>MP-COS</td>\n                      <td>75.13</td>\n                      <td>82.45</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"bottom-line\">MP-DOT</td>\n                      <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">75.94</td>\n                      <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">83.01</td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </table>\n                <p>And the result for paper citation matching is table 2.</p>\n                <table class=\"result-data\" cellspacing=0>\n                    <caption>Table2: Results on the task of paper citation matching.</caption>\n                    <tr>\n                      <th class=\"top-line\">Model</th>\n                      <th class=\"top-line\">Acc.(%)</th>\n                      <th class=\"top-line\">F<sub>1</sub>(%)</th>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">ALL POSITIVE</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">33.33</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">50.00</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>TF-IDF</td>\n                      <td>82.63</td>\n                      <td>70.21</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">DSSM</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">71.97</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">29.88</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>CDSSM</td>\n                      <td>69.84</td>\n                      <td>19.97</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>ARC-I</td>\n                      <td>84.51</td>\n                      <td>76.79</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>ARC-II</td>\n                      <td>86.48</td>\n                      <td>79.57</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">MP-IND</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">73.76</td>\n                      <td class=\"top-line\">44.71</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>MP-COS</td>\n                      <td>86.65</td>\n                      <td>79.70</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td class=\"bottom-line\">MP-DOT</td>\n                      <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">88.73</td>\n                      <td class=\"bottom-line text-weight\">82.86</td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </table>\n                <h2>4.Reference</h2>\n                <p>[1] Liang Pang, Shengxian Wan, Yanyan Lan, et al.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>The DUET model is compose by two separate deep neural networks, one that matches the query and the document using a local representation which is always captured by exact term matches, and another that matches the query and the document using learned distributed representations which is always captured in a latent semantic space. The two DNNs  are jointly trained as part of a single neural network, so it is named as a ‘duet’ architecture because the two networks co-operate to achieve a common goal.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the DUET is shown in the figure. The DUET model projects the query and the document text into an embedding space before matching. The final score under the DUET setup is the sum of scores from the local and the distributed networks. The local model estimates document relevance based on patterns of exact matches of query terms in the document. It generates a interaction matrix which captures every exact match (and position) of query terms in the document. The interaction matrix is first passed through a convolutional layer and then passed through two fully-connected layers, a dropout layer, and a final fully-connected layer that produces a single real-valued output.The distributed model learns dense lower-dimensional vector representations of the query and the document text, and then computes the positional similarity between them in the learnt embedding space. Instead of a one-hot encoding of terms, as in the local model, it use a character n-graph based representation of each term in the query and document. The character-based input then pass through convolution step and then conduct a max-pooling step. The output of the max-pooling layer for the query is then passed through a fully-connected layer. For the document, the output is operated on by another convolutional layer. Finally, it conduct the element-wise or Hadamard product between the embedded document matrix and the extended or broadcasted query embedding. After this, we pass the matrix through fully connected layers, and a dropout layer until we arrive at a single score.</p>\n                <h2>3.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>The MV-LSTM model is a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence representations. Specifically, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM). The matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence representations which can aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching , through k-Max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the MV-LSTM is shown in the figure 1.  MV-LSTM consists of three parts: Firstly, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at one position which requires to reflect the representation of the whole sentence when attending to this position, so it is generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM); Secondly, the interactions between different positional sentence representations form a similarity matrix/tensor by different similarity functions----cosine, bilinear and tensor layer; Lastly, the final matching score is produced by aggregating such interactions through k-Max pooling and a multilayer perceptron.</p>\n                <h2>3. Performances</h2>\n                <p>The experiments of  MV-LSTM is conducted on  two task question answering and sentence completion with TREC QA dataset. The overall results are summarized in below Table.</p>\n                <table class=\"result-data\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n                  <caption>Table 1: Experimental results on QA.</caption>\n

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>DSSM stands for Deep Structured Semantic Model, or more general, Deep Semantic Similarity Model. It is developed for representing text strings (sentences, queries, predicates, entity mentions, etc.) in a continuous semantic space and modeling semantic similarity between two text strings (e.g., Sent2Vec) by the MSR Deep Learning Technology Center(DLTC).</p>\n                <p>DSSM uses a deep neural network (DNN) to rank a set of documents for a given query as follows. First, a non-linear projection is performed to map the query and the documents to a common semantic space. Then, the relevance of each document given the query is calculated as the cosine similarity between their vectors in that semantic space. The neural network models are discriminatively trained using the clickthrough data such that the conditional likelihood of the clicked document given the query is maximized. Different from the previous latent semantic models that are learned in an unsupervised fashion, the models are optimized directly for Web document ranking, and thus give superior performance. Furthermore, to deal with large vocabularies, researchers propose the so-called word hashing method, through which the high-dimensional term vectors of queries or documents are projected to low-dimensional letter based n-gram vectors with little information loss.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The figure on the right is an illustration of the DSSM. It uses a DNN to map a 500K sparse feature vector to a dense vector in 128 dimensions. The original input vector x contains 500k dimensions, which are reduced to 30k by word hashing method. Then, as we can see in the figure, 3 layers of non-linear projections are performed. A 30k * 300 weight matrix W2 and a bias b2 with 300 dimensions is used to transform the first layer with 30k units to the second layer with 300 units. And so on, the second layer with 300 units is transformed to the third layer with 300 units, and the third layer is then transformed to the final result vector y with 128 dimensions.</p>\n                <h2>3. Performances</h2>\n                <p>researchers have evaluated the retrieval models on a large-scale real world data set, called the evaluation data set henceforth. The evaluation data set contains 16,510 English queries sampled from one-year query log files of a commercial search engine. On average, each query is associated with 15 Web documents (URLs). Each query-title pair has a relevance label. The label is human generated and is on a 5-level relevance scale, 0 to 4, where level 4 means that the document is the most relevant to query Q and 0 means D is not relevant to Q. All the queries and documents are preprocessed such that the text is white-space tokenized and lowercased, numbers are retained, and no stemming/inflection is performed. The performance of all ranking models researchers have evaluated has been measured by mean Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) , and NDCG scores will be reported at truncation levels 1, 3, and 10.</p>\n                <p>The main results of experiments are summarized in the following table, where researchers compared the best version of the DSSM (Row 12) with three sets of baseline models. The first set of baselines includes a couple of widely used lexical matching methods such as TF-IDF (Row 1) and BM25 (Row 2). The second is a word translation model (WTM in Row 3) which is intended to directly address the query-document language discrepancy problem by learning a lexical mapping between query words and document words. The third includes a set of state-of-the-art latent semantic models which are learned either on documents only in an unsupervised manner (LSA, PLSA, DAE as in Rows 4 to 6) or on clickthrough data in a supervised way (BLTM-PR, DPM, as in Rows 7 and 8).</p>\n                <img src=\"../../../assets/dssm_exp_result.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"80%\">\n              </div>\n            </el-scrollbar>\n          </el-card>\n        </el-col>\n        <el-col :span=\"9\">\n          <el-scrollbar style=\"height:100%;\">\n            <div class=\"description-content\">\n              <el-card>\n                <el-scrollbar style=\"height:100%;\">\n                  <img src=\"../../../assets/dssm-structure.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n                </el-scrollbar>\n              </el-card>\n            </div>\n          </el-scrollbar>\n        </el-col>\n      </el-row>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n  export default {\n    name: 'Description',\n    mounted: function () {\n      // 为了得到卡片的高度，得到窗口的高度\n      var winHeight = 0\n      if (window.innerHeight) {\n        winHeight = window.innerHeight\n      } else if ((document.body) && (document.body.clientHeight)) {\n        winHeight = document.body.clientHeight\n      }\n      if (document.documentElement && document.documentElement.clientHeight) {\n        winHeight = document.documentElement.clientHeight\n      }\n      //设置两张卡片的高度\n      document.querySelector('.el-card__body').style.height = winHeight - 60 - 20 - 40 - 10 - 70 + 'px'\n      document.querySelectorAll('.el-card__body')[1].style.height = winHeight - 60 - 20 - 40 - 10 - 70 + 'px'\n      // console.log(document.querySelectorAll('.el-scrollbar__wrap'))\n      var scrollbar_list = document.querySelectorAll('.el-scrollbar__wrap')\n      console.log(scrollbar_list)\n      for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        scrollbar_list[i].style.overflowX = 'hidden'\n      }\n      //设置content区域的高度\n      var content_block = document.querySelectorAll('.description-content')\n      var content_height = winHeight - 60 + 'px'\n      for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n        content_block[i].style.height = content_height\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n  .description-content {\n    text-align: left;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    line-height: 24px;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-family: \"Lato\", \"proxima-nova\", \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif;\n  }\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/MatchZoo/ANMM/Description.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"anmm-description\"}},[_c('el-row',{attrs:{\"gutter\":20}},[_c('el-col',{attrs:{\"span\":15}},[_c('el-card',[_c('el-scrollbar',{staticStyle:{\"height\":\"100%\"}},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"description-content\"},[_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"1.

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>The KNRM stands for the Kernel based Neural Ranking Model, which is a model published in SIGIR 2017. The paper title is “End-to-End Neural Ad-ho Ranking with Kernel Pooling”. Given a query and a set of documents, KNRM uses a translation matrix that models word-level similarities via word embeddings, a new kernel-pooling technique that uses kernels to extract multi-level soft match features, and a learning-to-rank layer that combines those features into the final ranking score.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the KNRM  is shown in the figure. The KNRM contains three components: translation model, kernel-pooling, and learning to rank. The translation model uses an embedding layer to map each word to an L-dimension embedding. The translation layer constructs a translation matrix. The Kernel-pooling layer uses kernels to convert word-word interactions in the translation matrix to query-document ranking features. The kernel pooling layer employs RBF kernel to map each query word’s row of the translation matrix, summarizing (pooling) it into a K-dimensional feature vector. The learning to rank layer utilizes a linear layer to learn the final relevance score.</p>\n                <h2>3. Performances</h2>\n                <p>The experiments of KNRM is conducted on search logs of Sougou.com, a major Chinese commercial search engine. The details of the collections are provided in Table 1.</p>\n                <table class=\"result-data60\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n                  <caption>Table 1: Training and testing dataset

Introduction</h2>\n                <p>The Conv-KNRM stands for the convolutional kernel-based neural ranking model, which is published WSDM 2018. The paper title is “Convolutional Neural Networks for Soft-Matching N-Grams in Ad-hoc Search”. The Conv-KNRM uses convolutional neural networks to represent n-grams of various lengths and soft matches them in a unified embedding space. The n-gram soft matches are then utilized by the kernel pooling and learning-to-rank layers to generate the final ranking score.</p>\n                <h2>2. Structure</h2>\n                <p>The overall structure of the Conv-KNRM  is shown in the figure. Given a query and a document, Conv-KNRM embeds their words by a word embedding layer, composes n-grams with a CNN layer, and cross-matches query n-grams and document n-grams of variant lengths to the translation matrices. Firstly, the word embedding layer maps each word to an L-dimension continuous vector. Secondly, the convolutional layer applies convolution filters to compose n-grams from the text. A convolution filter slide over the text like a sliding window. Thirdly, the cross-match layer matches query n-grams and document n-grams of different lengths. Then, as is the same with KNRM model, Conv-KNRM uses the kernel-pooling technique and a learning-to-rank layer to calculate the ranking score using the n-gram translations.</p>\n                <h2>3. Performances</h2>\n                <p>The experiments of Conv-KNRM is conducted on two search logs in different languages (Sougou, Bing), and a TREC dataset (ClueWeb09-B). The details of the two collections are provided in Table 1.</p>\n                <table class=\"result-data60\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n                  <caption>Table 1: Training and testing dataset

Firstly, the word embedding layer maps each word to an L-dimension continuous vector. Secondly, the convolutional layer applies convolution filters to compose n-grams from the text. A convolution filter slide over the text like a sliding window. Thirdly, the cross-match layer matches query n-grams and document n-grams of different lengths.

matching. It was developed with a focus on facilitating the design, comparison and sharing of deep text matching models. There are a number of deep matching methods, such as DRMM, MatchPyramid, MV-LSTM, aNMM, DUET, ARC-I, ARC-II, DSSM, and CDSSM, designed with a unified interface (collection of papers: <a href=\"https://github.com/NTSC-Community/awaresome-neural-models-for-semantic-match\">awesome-neural-models-for-semantic-match</a>). Potential tasks related to MatchZoo include document retrieval, question answering, conversational response ranking, paraphrase identification, etc. We are always happy to receive any code contributions, suggestions, comments from all our MatchZoo users.</p>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th width=\"30%,\" bgcolor=\"#999999\">Tasks</th> \n    <th width=\"20%,\" bgcolor=\"#999999\">Text 1</th>\n    <th width=\"20%\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#999999\">Text 2</th>\n    <th width=\"20%\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#999999\">Objective</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> Paraphrase Indentification </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> string 1 </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> string 2 </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> classification </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> Textual Entailment </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> text </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> hypothesis </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> classification </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> Question Answer </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> question </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> answer </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> classification/ranking </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> Conversation </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> dialog </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> response </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> classification/ranking </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> Information Retrieval </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> query </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> document </td>\n    <td align=\"center\" ,=\"\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"> ranking </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<h2>We're actively developing MatchZoo 2.0 with everything improved, stay tuned!

Before the first stable release (1.0), please clone the repository and run</p>\n<pre v-pre=\"\"><code v-pre=\"\">git clone https://github.com/NTMC-Community/MatchZoo.git\ncd MatchZoo\npython setup.py install\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the main directory, this will install the dependencies automatically.</p>\n<p>For usage examples, you can run</p>\n<pre v-pre=\"\"><code v-pre=\"\">python matchzoo/main.py --phase train --model_file examples/toy_example/config/arci_ranking.config\npython matchzoo/main.py --phase predict --model_file examples/toy_example/config/arci_ranking.config\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>The architecture of the MatchZoo toolkit is described in the Figure  in what follows,</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"../../../assets/matchzoo-logo.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=\"center\">\n</div>  \n<p>There are three major modules in the toolkit, namely data preparation, model construction, training and evaluation, respectively. These three modules are actually organized as a pipeline of data flow.</p>\n<h3>Data Preparation</h3>\n<p>The data preparation module aims to convert dataset of different text matching tasks into a unified format as the input of deep matching models. Users provide datasets which contains pairs of texts along with their labels, and the module produces the following files.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Word Dictionary</strong>: records the mapping from each word to a unique identifier called <em>wid</em>. Words that are too frequent (e.g. stopwords), too rare or noisy (e.g. fax numbers) can be  filtered out by predefined rules.</li>\n<li><strong>Corpus File</strong>: records the mapping from each text to a unique identifier called <em>tid</em>, along with a sequence of word identifiers contained in that text. Note here each text is truncated or padded to a fixed length customized by users.</li>\n<li><strong>Relation File</strong>: is used to store the relationship between two texts, each line containing a pair of <em>tids</em> and the corresponding label.</li>\n<li><strong>Detailed Input Data Format</strong>: a detailed explaination of input data format can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/NTMC-Community/MatchZoo/blob/master/data/toy_example/readme.md\">MatchZoo/data/toy_example/readme.md</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Model Construction</h3>\n<p>In the model construction module, we employ Keras library to help users build the deep matching model layer by layer conveniently. The Keras libarary provides a set of common layers widely used in neural models, such as convolutional layer, pooling layer, dense layer and so on. To further facilitate the construction of deep text matching models, we extend the Keras library to provide some layer interfaces specifically designed for text matching.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the toolkit has implemented two schools of representative deep text matching models, namely representation-focused models and interaction-focused models <a href=\"http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~gjf/papers/2016/CIKM2016a_guo.pdf\">[Guo et al.]</a>.</p>\n<h3>Training and Evaluation</h3>\n<p>For learning the deep matching models, the toolkit provides a variety of objective functions for regression, classification and ranking. For example, the ranking-related objective functions include several well-known pointwise, pairwise and listwise losses. It is flexible for users to pick up different objective functions in the training phase for optimization. Once a model has been trained, the toolkit could be used to produce a matching score, predict a matching label, or rank target texts (e.g., a document) against an input text.</p>\n<h2>Benchmark Results:</h2>\n<p>Here, We adopt two representative datasets for examples to show the usage of MatchZoo for ranking and classification. For ranking task, we use <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52419\">WikiQA</a> dataset as an example. For classification task, we use <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/\">QuoraQP</a> dataset as an example.</p>\n<h3>WikiQA for Ranking</h3>\n<p>WikiQA is a popular benchmark dataset for answer sentence selection in question answering.
